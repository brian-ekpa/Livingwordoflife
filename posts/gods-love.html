    <p class="mb-4">No matter what you've done, God’s love remains. His mercy is new every morning, and His grace reaches farther than our failures. The Bible says in Romans 8:38-39 that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Let this be your reminder today: you are deeply loved by the Creator of the universe. Run to Him, rest in Him, and walk in His unfailing love.</p>
    <p class="italic mt-6">“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning.” – Lamentations 3:22-23</p>
